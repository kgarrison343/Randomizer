Simple Randomizer for a variety of uses.
Looks in the ./Choices directory for files, allowing you to choose one; it then randomly selects a line of text to output.
Useful for such things as:
Deciding on lunch
Determining which podcast to listen to next
Playing spin the bottle when you don't have a bottle
...And much more!!!!

Future versions will include:
Ability to add weights to each item to bias your randomization
Creating the files within the program (load, edit, and save)
UI integration?
